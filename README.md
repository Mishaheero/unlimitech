## Recruitment Task

The goal of the project was to create a view that conforms to the design in Figma. The website was designed using SASS/SCSS, jQuery, and the Slick Slider library. Additionally, lazy loading of images from the API picsum.photos was implemented to optimize the performance of the page.

## Technologies
- **HTML**: Semantic and readable structure.
- **SASS/SCSS**: Use of a preprocessor for styling, with modular division.
- **JavaScript/jQuery**: Carousel functionality.
- **Slick Slider**: Library for creating the slider.
- **Webpack**: A bundling tool that simplifies resource management and code optimization.
- **API**: Fetching images from the [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos/) API.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented to optimize image loading.

## Styling
Styling was implemented using SASS/SCSS, allowing for better organization of code and reuse of styles.

## Interactivity
Interactivity was added using jQuery. The use of the Slick Slider library enabled the creation of a responsive carousel, according to the design.

## Webpack
Webpack was used for resource management, bundling, and SASS/SCSS compilation.

## GitHub Repository
The entire project has been hosted in a GitHub repository. Examples of commit naming conventions include:
- `Feature: Add header section`
- `Fix: Repair mobile navigation`
- `Style: Update button styles`
- `Docs: Update project documentation`

## Images
Images in the "Categories" section are fetched from the [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos/) API. The implementation of lazy loading allows for optimal image loading, improving page performance and user experience.
